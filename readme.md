goal: have a stream layout that helps people join and get their bearings

see stream-view.png for high-level layout
	- should make code the focus (when in terminal)
	- include chat
	- include music
	- include keystrokes
		- widget that shows "how" I'm typing
		- answers questions like "what movement command was that in vim?"
		- persists long enough for seqs to be grokked
	- stream metadata
	- speed runner 'splits'
